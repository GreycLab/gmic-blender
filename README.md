# gmic-blender


This WIP official G'MIC plugin for Blender3D makes use of the [G'MIC Python binding](https://github.com/dtschump/gmic-py) and will add new Nodes to Blender3d without forking Blender's code. This project is under the CeCILL-A free software license.

Estimated time of arrival of 1 first generic Node: mid-february 2020.

This is being worked on at the CNRS GREYC Image public research laboratory in Caen, France.

## Installing
